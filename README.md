# Sunglasses Hut Web Scraping for Product Details and Brand Comparisons

This project has a few components.

1) sunglass_hut folder is a Scrapy Spider that scrapes the Sunglass Hut for product details on all of their sunglasses
First, sunglass_hut.py must run to scrape the urls into url.csv using Selenium. This is then passed to the spider folder. It is currently urls_copy.csv

2) Woot! is also scraped for it's sunglasses and details. That is the sunglasses folder and the Spider it contains.

3) The jupyter notebook sunglass_hut_woot_eda explores the data and matches sunglasses on woot! with possible matches on sunglass hut.

4) There is a keynote presentation for further explanation
